Halden Electronics is excited to announce this year's model: the epitome of design, dependability, and luxury.

# Company Hauler
This mod adds an new vehicle—the ***COMPANY HAULER***—to the terminal for `600` credits. It is a four door pickup truck with an enclosed roof.

Note: this is *NOT* a cruiser model replacement mod. It adds a whole new vehicle to the terminal, courtesy of LLL!
Speaking of which, this should be compatible with all vehicle mods that also use LLL.

## Features
* Four seats
* Vanilla-style design
* Enclosed roof - protects against forest giants
* Working tachometer, speedometer, and warning lights
* Side mirrors
* Neat interactables like automatic windows, a sunroof, and a tailgate!
* More than **2x** the health of the Cruiser, *at the expense of having no boost*
* **6** radio songs
* Custom sounds, driver animations, and manual
* Other things...?
